## 6. User Experience Design

### 6.1 Design Principles
- **Minimalism**: Clean, uncluttered interface focusing on content
- **Speed**: Every interaction should feel instantaneous
- **Consistency**: Unified experience across all platforms
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and high contrast modes

### 6.2 Information Architecture
```
App Structure:
├── Home Dashboard
│   ├── Recent Notes
│   ├── Quick Capture
│   └── Search Bar
├── Organization
│   ├── All Notes
│   ├── Folders
│   └── Tags
├── Search & Filter
└── Settings
    ├── Appearance
    ├── Sync & Backup
    └── Export/Import
```

### 6.3 Key User Flows

#### Primary Flow: Quick Note Creation
1. User opens app → Home screen loads instantly
2. Tap "+" button or quick capture widget
3. Type/dictate note content
4. Add tags (optional, with auto-suggestions)
5. Save automatically → Return to home screen

#### Secondary Flow: Note Organization
1. Long-press note → Context menu appears
2. Select "Move to folder" or "Add tags"
3. Choose destination or type new tags
4. Confirm action → Visual feedback

## 7. Technical Architecture

### 7.1 Technology Stack

#### Frontend Framework
- **Lynx with ReactLynx**: Leveraging ByteDance's cross-platform framework for native performance
- **React Hooks**: For state management and component logic
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and developer experience

#### UI Components
- **Lynx native elements**: `<view>`, `<text>`, `<image>` for optimal performance
- **Custom component library**: Built on Lynx primitives
- **CSS-in-JS**: For dynamic styling and theming

#### Backend & Sync
- **Local-first architecture**: SQLite for local storage
- **Cloud sync service**: Firebase or custom REST API
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket connections for live sync

### 7.2 Performance Optimizations

#### Lynx-Specific Benefits
- **Dual-threaded execution**: UI rendering separate from business logic
- **Native performance**: 2-4x faster launch times compared to other cross-platform solutions
- **Optimized builds**: Rust-based toolchain (Rspeedy) for faster compilation

#### App-Specific Optimizations
- **Lazy loading**: Load notes on-demand
- **Virtual scrolling**: For large note lists
- **Incremental search**: Real-time filtering with debouncing
- **Background sync**: Non-blocking data synchronization

### 7.3 AI Assistant Layer

- **Local-first suggestions**: FastAPI proxies AI calls through `/api/ai/*`, defaulting to stub mode for development.
- **Configurable runners**: Supports on-device inference (Ollama/llama.cpp) or remote endpoints selected via `AI_MODE`.
- **Asynchronous delivery**: Frontend consumes suggestions through a dedicated AI client and debounced hooks to keep UI responsive.
- **Graceful fallback**: When AI is disabled or unavailable, the capture flow operates as a standard note-taker with clear messaging.
